Roboflow is an end-to-end computer vision platform that helps you
* collaborate with your team on computer vision projects
* collect & organize images
* understand and search unstructured image data
* annotate, and create datasets
* export, train, and deploy computer vision models
* use active learning to improve your dataset over time

For state of the art Computer Vision training notebooks you can use with this dataset,

The dataset includes 993 images.
Hazard-pictograms are annotated in YOLOv8 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Fit (white edges))

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random rotation of between -21 and +21 degrees
* Random shear of between -23° to +23° horizontally and -13° to +13° vertically
* Random exposure adjustment of between -45 and +45 percent
